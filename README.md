# Synology Surveillance Station API in Python

I have no real intention of making this a general-purpose Python module
but I figured it can't hurt to at least post the code on GitHub.

All I'm hoping to do here is automate a few control actions so I can 
work with Surveillance Station with my Home Assistant automation.
